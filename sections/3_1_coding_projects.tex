        \item{Created a Machine Learning Project with the goal of identifying what road lane a user is located}
        \item{Wrote an \textbf{Kotlin/Android} application that continuously captures LTE Base Station Access Points signal intensities, magnetometer, and GPS coordinates, allowing the categorization of signal fingerprints as 'road lane' labels used for training}
        \item{Implemented data filtering subroutines in \textbf{python/pandas/numpy} used for cleaning and preprocessing noisy signals}
        \item{Collected training data using the MagRSS application by going around campus and labeling certain routes depending on where the logs were taken. 120k entries total for demonstrating the proof-of-concept}
        \item{Developed a Back Propagation Neural Network in \textbf{python/tensorflow} that is trained on the collected data and makes predictions on test data. Achieved close to 90\% accuracy}

        \item{Installed a Robot Operating System (ROS) service instance on a drone controlled by a Raspberry Pi}
        \item{Developed an \textbf{Kotlin/Android} application that brings the user a Joystick UI and sends flight instructions to the ROS controlled drone}
        \item{Setup a TCP socket connection between an Android application and the ROS controlled drone, both of which were connected to a special LTE testbed network provided by school for experimental purposes}

        \item{Developed a \textbf{Java/Android} application that uses the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope and implemented an Inertial Navigation Unit (INU)}
        \item{Enhanced INU signals by applying a Kalman-Filter that constantly adjusts on feedback from the sensors}
        \item{Displayed the path the user has taken so far on-screen}

        \item{Created an IoT connected Robot car with an attached USB webcam and fake/toy gun used for security surveillance}
        \item{Integrated a motion-detection library/process with the webcam video feed to trigger an email notification to subscribed users}
        \item{Developed both \textbf{Java/Android} and \textbf{Swift/iOS} applications that display the video feed from the IoT connected Robot and provides UI joystick controllers to move the Robot and trigger the toy gun}
